##Fetcher

A production scale HTTP fetcher.

A large scale fetcher should be limited by the speed of fetching results and streaming them to disk.  We don't want other communication or processing happening in the fetcher.  Rather, other services listen on the fetcher's results and pick up work by polling disk or listening on some channel.
